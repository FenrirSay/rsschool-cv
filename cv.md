My goal is to learn to speak different programming languages for creating websites and working in this area. My strengths are the desire to learn new things and perseverance. Unfortunately, there is not much work experience yet, unless, of course, you count small pilot projects for the university during your studies.\

The skills at the moment have the basics С++, HTML и CSS.\
